## My_Netflix_data_analysis
Using my Netflix account data I will analyze my viewing habits of the household and visualize some of my findings.



 This project is an ongoing learning project that will be built on as I learn different things using pandas and other libraries installed.

Getting the Program to Run:
Confirm that a version of Python 3 has been installed on your local machine

Use Git Bash and navigate to where you would like the cloned repository using CD'command(the desired path)

Clone the repo from github.

To make sure you have all necessary packages to run the program you will need to read the requirments.txt file in the repo.

Once repo is cloned, use File Explorer or command promt to navigate to the directory folder that contains the repo.

Once you have navigated to the folder, from the file path line type "cmd" to bring up the command prompt in that directory.

From the command line, run "jupyter notebook", this will open a browser window.

From the browser window open "My_Netflix_data_analysis.ipynb",to run the program.

Once you have opened the file click "Run All' on the top of the notebook.

##Requirements
                                 Requirements met for this project:
Requiremnets are from the project requirements list from Code Kentucky list of requirements for Data analysis part 2:

1. Read in data: Read in two data files. This project consist of two csv files that used the pandas function in the pandas python package to   read the files to create dataframes.

2. Manipulated and cleaned the data: Used in built-pandas and numpy functions to remove such things as NAN values in the data. Also used other pandas functions to manipulate the data to provide new values and renaming of columns and merged the dataframes later in the project to get other data in one datafrmae table.

3. Visulize/Present the data: Make at least 3 visualizations. I use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to do these visulalizations. 

4. Utilize best practices.  I created a virtual environment for my project.  Instructions on how to set a virtual environment are listed below.

    Activiating a virtual environment in windows using VS code you will need to Run powershell in administrator and copy and paste this command: set-executionpolicy remotesigned ; then agree to the message.  Finally, Run your_virtualenv_name\Scripts\activiate.ps1

5. Interpretation of the data. I have used markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to do this interpretation of my code and data.
